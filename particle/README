Particle Class

Note1 : PID class objects are not created (as default).
	When PID routines of each detectors will be prepared 
	and become usable, this class should be changed largely
	to use them.

Note2 : Search of "decay.dec"
	1. $QQ_DECAY_TABLE
	2. $BELLE_TOP_DIR/share/data-files/qq98/decay.dec
	3. decay.dec at the current directory

Note3 : Search of "user.dec"
	1. $QQ_USER_TABLE
	2. without user.dec

Note4 : When you obtain the following message, you check Note2 and 3.

	| (Particle Class)PANTHER table for QQ not found                |
	| (Particle Class)creating from "decay.dec" and "user.dec" ...  |
	| (Particle Class)FAILUR in creation!                           |
